To conclude, Sue gave the audience a chance to ask a few questions. Here are the questions and answers in a nutshell.


Q. Is there any specific punctuation that works particularly better than others?
================================================================================

A. It depends on context – even though punctuation is recommended, be careful not to abuse it. If you’re a charity, you might want to be “strict” with your punctuation, using a more serious tone perhaps; on the other hand, if you’re in showbiz you’re free to use punctuation in a way that suits you/your brand best. In general, tweets with colons (:) are more retweeted that tweets with semicolons (;), probably because not everyone is certain on how to use the latter. However, don’t look at punctuation too much: if you have a perfectly worded tweet, don’t fill it with unnecessary punctuation. Remember: be concise and straight to the point.


Q. How do you track how well your tweets are doing?
===================================================

A. You can use Hootsuite or Buffer to track this. One way to broadcast your tweets further is to ask people who are more influential in your area of interest to retweet your content. If successful, your tweets will be shared to a wider audience and you’ll also gain more followers. If you’re using Facebook to publish your content, check Facebook insight to see how well you’re doing.
